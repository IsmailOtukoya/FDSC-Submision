# Medical Charges Prediction Project
## Overview

This project aims to predict medical charges for an insurance company using linear regression. The dataset "insurance" is provided for analysis and model development.

## Task Goals
The project was carried out with the following task goals in mind:

### Task:
- Find the summary statistics of the variable charges in the dataset
- Display a table that contains the number of people in each region
- Visualize the relationship among all features using a scatterplot matrix
- Train a model on the data
- Evaluate the model performance
- Improve the model performance by Adding nonlinear relationship (Hint consider only age as input)
### Additional Task (Assumption):
- Since smoking and obesity may have a harmful impact, we assume the combination of the two may be worse. Build a model with the interaction effects of smokers and obesity (Obesity is considered for BMI > 30).
- Improve your regression model by putting a and b together.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Data Understanding and Exploration
- Code Quality and Documentation
- Visualization and Feature Relationships
- Model Performance and Evaluation
- Dataset
  
The dataset "insurance" contains information about individuals' age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, region, and corresponding medical charges.

## Analysis Steps
- Data Exploration: Analyzed summary statistics of medical charges and the distribution of categorical variables. Visualized relationships among features using scatterplot matrix.

- Model Building: Developed regression models to predict medical charges, considering linear and nonlinear relationships. Explored interaction effects between smoking and obesity.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using common regression evaluation metrics. Conducted residual analysis to identify areas for improvement.

### Results and Recommendations
The project provides insights into factors influencing medical charges and develops predictive models to estimate healthcare costs.
Recommendations include collecting additional data on lifestyle factors, exploring advanced machine learning techniques, and conducting further analysis to understand underlying factors driving medical expenses.

### Conclusion
The Medical Charges Prediction Project addresses the task goals by leveraging regression analysis and machine learning techniques. By predicting medical charges accurately, the project aims to assist healthcare providers, insurers, and policymakers in making informed decisions and improving healthcare resource allocation.
